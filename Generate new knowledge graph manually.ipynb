    "LANDLORD-TENANT TENSION RISES OVER ISSUES OF RIGHTS AND RULES\n",
    "\n",
    "BYLINE: By WILLIAM G. BLAIR\n",

    "SECTION: Section 8; Page 1, Column 3; Real Estate Desk\n",

    "LENGTH: 1926 words\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Complaints against landlords in New York City are sharply on the rise, according\n",
    "to public and private agencies concerned with the problem. The majority of the\n",
    "complaints are about alleged overcharging, but apparently stricter landlord\n",
    "enforcement of rental leases is also prompting inquiries from tenants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frank S. Kristof, president of a group that represents owners of rent-stabilized\n",
    "apartments, said the association was getting 600 calls a day, compared with 20\n",
    "or 30 a day not too long ago. He said that 62 percent of the calls were from\n",
    "tenants and 38 percent from owners. He explained that he thought the upsurge was\n",
    "''directly related to the tightness of the market.'' Landlords, he said, are\n",
    "being ''sorely tempted by the eagerness of tenants to find homes.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Jane Benedict, chairman and a founder of the 21-year-old Metropolitan Council of\n",
    "Housing, the biggest citywide tenant union, said the council ''became aware\n",
    "about a year ago of an accelerated effort by landlords to enforce technical\n",
    "aspects of leases.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''Our phones started jumping off their hooks,'' she said, ''and now we're\n",
    "getting a flood of complaints,'' from increasingly organized tenants. By\n",
    "invoking ''all kinds of technical matters,'' she said, the owners hope to ''get\n",
    "rid of'' the existing occupant and bring in a new tenant at an increased rent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ellis Franke, executive director of the City Conciliation and Appeals Board,\n",
    "which adjudicates tenant-landlord disputes in rentstabilized apartments, said\n",
    "that complaints of overcharging in the six-month period ending in March were 47\n",
    "percent greater than in the preceding half-year.\n",
    "\n",
    "She added that complaints were ''now coming in at a rate that will be in the\n",
    "neighborhood of 4,000 a year, and that's double what it was two years ago.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Stephen Mindell, an assistant attorney general in the state Attorney General's\n",
    "office, said it was ''very disturbing to us to find that in a substantial number\n",
    "of cases, the self-regulating system of rent stabilization does not appear to be\n",
    "working.'' Mr.  Mindell is in charge of a continuing investigation into rent\n",
    "overcharges begun by the attorney general's office in February 1979.  His\n",
    "office, he said, has obtained $700,000 in refunds to tenants.\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City's rental housing essentially operates under two separate systems:\n",
    "the Rent Stabilization Law for 850,000 apartments and the Rent Control Law for\n",
    "400,000 others. Rent stabilization, which took effect in 1969, was fashioned to\n",
    "be largely selfregulating. Rent control, which began under Federal auspices in\n",
    "World War II and then was taken over by states and localities, is administered\n",
    "here by the city government.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rent increases in rent-stabilized apartments are set each year by the Rent\n",
    "Guidelines Board. Under rent control, the city must approve any building's rent\n",
    "increase. There is no public registration of leases for rent-stabilized\n",
    "apartments to which a tenant can turn.  But for rent-controlled apartments, the\n",
    "city keeps public records of rents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtually everyone involved in rental housing problems here agrees that the\n",
    "combination of two laws with their complexity, particularly that of rent\n",
    "stabilization, leads to a large measure of ignorance about their rights and\n",
    "obligations by both tenants and landlords.  Efforts are under way to reform and\n",
    "consolidate the systems, but the problem is a highly complicated and emotional\n",
    "one that will not lend itself easily to solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of last month, all new and renewal leases for such apartments must henceforth\n",
    "include a rider that advises tenants and owners of their rights and obligations\n",
    "under the Rent Stabilization Law. But the rider, which covers such potentially\n",
    "contentious points as permissible rent increases, subletting, services, eviction\n",
    "and cooperative and condominium conversion, stresses that it is only\n",
    "informational and is not a part of the lease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reform of the lease itself is the aim of a joint effort now being undertaken by\n",
    "Mr. Mindell, the assistant attorney general, and the New York Real Estate Board,\n",
    "which provides the standard lease used by many landlords in Manhattan. However,\n",
    "landlords are free to modify the lease. Mr. Mindell said he was seeking plain\n",
    "language in the standard lease as required by the state's Plain English Law.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, he said, his office is also trying to ''reform some of the lease\n",
    "clauses to equalize the bargaining position of the tenant vis-a-vis the landlord\n",
    "in light of the current law.'' He expressed optimism about the outcome of the\n",
    "negotiations with the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "Miss Franke said she hoped that including the rights statement in leases would\n",
    "help matters because the bulk of the cases coming before the Conciliation and\n",
    "Appeals Board ''involve new tenants who don't know the rental history of the\n",
    "apartment they are taking.'' Without this history, now incorporated in the\n",
    "rights statement, the tenant ''is absolutely in the dark'' about what the rent\n",
    "should be, she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasingly, she said of new-tenant rent dispute cases, the board has been\n",
    "getting fewer rental histories from owners ''who are unwilling or unable to\n",
    "provide them - and more are unwilling than unable.''\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sort of impasse, Miss Franke explained, the landlords frequently\n",
    "default. Then, she said, ''we issue an interim order which rolls back the rent\n",
    "by the applicable current rent guidelines plus 15 percent.'' The 15 percent is\n",
    "the new-vacancy allowance that landlords are permitted to charge new tenants who\n",
    "have signed or are about to sign new leases in the five-month period of Feb. 1\n",
    "to June 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before embarking on what can be a drawn-out and frustrating process of\n",
    "adjudication before the Conciliation and Appeals Board or the city's Housing\n",
    "Court, a tenant or landlord can try to iron out differences by seeking the\n",
    "informal mediation services of the Rent Stabilization Association. The\n",
    "association recently moved into new quarters with a much greater capacity to\n",
    "handle the quickening flow of telephone inquiries and complaints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Kristof, its president, said the association was settling 15 to 20 refund\n",
    "disputes a week. ''When we ascertain there has been an overcharge,'' he said,\n",
    "''in the overwhelming number of cases they are settled by owners with refunds to\n",
    "tenants.'' When it cannot mediate successfully, he added, the association refers\n",
    "the dispute to the Conciliation and Appeals Board.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last November Sheldon Katz, chairman of the association, announced that it was\n",
    "going to crack down on landlords who violated rent limits by inflicting harsh\n",
    "penalties as well as requiring refunds. ''We've got to head this thing off\n",
    "before it gets out of hand,'' he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Kristof, asked last month how many landlords had been penalized with fines\n",
    "of up to $500 or suspended or expelled from the association, said, ''To date,\n",
    "none.'' Under the Rent Stabilization Law, an owner suspended or expelled from\n",
    "the association has his properties placed under rent control, which generally\n",
    "means he must charge lower rents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Kristof observed, however, that half a dozen cases were scheduled for\n",
    "resolution by the association, none involving a major landlord. ''It's much\n",
    "easier to lean on major landlords because they don't want their reputations\n",
    "sullied,'' he said, adding that the association had found abuses more frequent\n",
    "among smaller owners.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the overcharge and legal permissible rent problems, Mr. Kristof\n",
    "said that other issues that were raised frequently included fuel cost\n",
    "pass-alongs, rents for senior citizens, apartment painting and subletting or\n",
    "apartment sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter, which in current parlance is known as the roommate problem, is\n",
    "described by Mrs. Benedict of the Metropolitan Council as ''a matter of economic\n",
    "necessity'' for many people who cannot afford the cost of living alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "William Moses, board chairman of CHIP (Community Housing Improvement Program)\n",
    "and the owner-manager of residential buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn, sees\n",
    "the problem from a different perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "''While tenants have a responsibility under the lease agreement to pay rent and\n",
    "take care of the apartment, people who move in illegally have none,'' Mr. Moses\n",
    "said. ''When illegal roommates show up, the landlord should take action.'' He\n",
    "maintained that a new lease, including a rent increase, could usually be worked\n",
    "out if the tenant whose name was on the lease informed the landlord of a change\n",
    "in the occupancy status.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the permutations of rent regulations has never been easy, but in\n",
    "recent years, because of the escalating cost of fuel, the introduction of fuel\n",
    "pass-alongs has further complicated an already complex situation. Miss Franke\n",
    "reported that there was widespread confusion among owners and tenants about the\n",
    "effective dates of passalongs, how they were computed, how long they were to\n",
    "remain in effect and who was affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "In April 1979, after stabilized rents had already been changed twice in a year\n",
    "by the Rent Guidelines Board, a variable fuel surcharge of up to 2.5 percent was\n",
    "added on, but only for tenants whose leases took effect between July 1, 1978,\n",
    "and June 30, 1979.  The adjustment was to apply for the duration of the leases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the surcharge was imposed, the Conciliation and Appeals Board was getting\n",
    "about 1,000 calls a day, but after it came ''we were getting about 10,000 calls\n",
    "a day,'' Miss Franke recalled. When fuel pass-alongs are applied incorrectly,\n",
    "Mr. Kristof said, ''more often than not we find it's from ignorance on the part\n",
    "of our landlords.''\n",
    "\n",
    "For tenants with leases dating from July 1, 1978, to June 30, 1979, there was\n",
    "still another fuel surcharge. This took effect last December when the Rent\n",
    "Guidelines Board added a temporary $12-a-month surcharge to be paid for the\n",
    "six-month period ending June 30. Similar action followed in March for many of\n",
    "the city's rent-controlled apartments when Mayor Koch signed a fuel surcharge\n",
    "measure retroactive to Jan. 1 that increased monthly rents by as much as $3.30 a\n",
    "room.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether the $12 fuel surcharges and the increased 15 percent vacancy allowance\n",
    "are to be extended beyond June 30 and in what manner are to be decided this\n",
    "month by the Rent Guidelines Board. As for the annual rent control fuel\n",
    "pass-along, landlords will be able to file for further increases next Jan. 1\n",
    "based on any increase in fuel oil prices this year.\n",

    "DATELINE: MIAMI, May 31\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A blazing sun was beginning to set on another sweltering Saturday in Miami when\n",
    "22-year-old Jeffrey Kult, his 18-year-old brother, Michael, and a friend,\n",
    "23-year-old Deborah Getman, set out for home after a day at the beach and a\n",
    "visit with friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "A short time later, Benny Higdon, a 21-year-old bakery worker and father of\n",
    "three, would call it a day at the fishing hole, load his gear in his old Dodge\n",
    "Dart and head for home. With him were his 15-year-old brother-in-law, Charles\n",
    "Barecca, and Robert Owens, also 15, Charles's friend from his freshman class at\n",
    "high school.\n",
    "\n",
    "The routes the two parties were to take would bring them along Northwest 62d\n",
    "Street and past 12th Parkway, to a poor, rundown and predominantly black section\n",
    "of Miami called Liberty City, where residents had begun to gather in groups much\n",
    "larger than normal for a Saturday night. And there their paths would intersect\n",
    "with an angry mob, including some angry young men who would be accused in the\n",
    "coming days of beating the passers-by and killing three of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Police Acquittals\n",
    "\n",
    "About three hours earlier, in Tampa, some 200 miles away, an allwhite jury had\n",
    "acquitted four whites, former policemen from Miami, of charges of using\n",
    "excessive force in trying to arrest a black, Arthur McDuffie, after pursuing him\n",
    "for a traffic violation.  According to testimony, Mr. McDuffie died of repeated\n",
    "blows to the head by nightsticks and large flashlights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word of the acquittals swept through Liberty City like a tidal wave. Blacks\n",
    "poured out of the hot and dilapidated houses and decrepit public housing\n",
    "complexes. On the littered streets, they shouted down the Tampa verdict as an\n",
    "example of how the ''system'' worked against them and for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not everyone had heard of the verdict. One man, who spoke anonymously for fear\n",
    "of retribution, said he and a companion were riding around the 62d Street area\n",
    "as they often do on Saturday nights, ''looking to see what was happening.''\n",
    "\n",
    "'Blow Your Horn, Brother'\n",
    "\n",
    "The man, one of the more fortunate residents of Liberty City in that he has a\n",
    "service job at a building downtown, slowed his vehicle as he neared a crowd that\n",
    "had set up a roadblock across 62d Street.  He rolled down his window.\n",
    "\n",
    "'' 'Blow your horn, brother,' '' he recalled voices from the crowd saying.\n",
    "''People were putting rocks in bottles and garbage cans they had pulled to the\n",
    "curb. We parked around on a side street and came back to see what was going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "''People that came by blowing their horns or with black rags tied to their\n",
    "antennas and mirrors didn't have any problem,'' he said.  ''They could get\n",
    "through.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The man recognized two men in the crowd, Leonard Joseph Capers and Lawrence\n",
    "Clifford Capers, brothers, 20 and 24 years old. He said Leonard Capers was\n",
    "showing off for the crowd.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was now sometime between 6 and 7 P.M.  Jeffrey Kult was wheeling his car\n",
    "along 62d Street and, unknowingly, toward the angry, waiting crowd. It was the\n",
    "wrong time and wrong place to be white.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Attack Begins\n",
    "\n",
    "As the car approached, ''the crowd started yelling, 'Crackers, crackers' and\n",
    "picking up rocks and bottles from the garbage cans,'' the man said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kult automobile was pelted with stones and bottles. Suddenly the windshield\n",
    "disintegrated.  ''You could see the driver trying to control the car but he\n",
    "couldn't,'' the man said. ''The rocks and bottles were still flying and the\n",
    "windshield was in his lap.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''The car jumped the median,'' the man recalled, ''and headed for a little girl\n",
    "and some other people standing on the side of an apartment building across the\n",
    "street. I was hoping that maybe the car had missed them, but then the side of\n",
    "the building turned from white to red and I knowed that somebody must have\n",
    "gotten killed. People started screaming.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''Two white people staggered out of the car,'' he said. ''One was waving his\n",
    "hands like he was pleading. About 10 to 15 people started throwing things at\n",
    "them. Me and my buddy knew it was time to get out of Dodge and we left.''\n",
    "\n",
    "A Dramatic Rescue\n",
    "\n",
    "According to police accounts of what happened then, the Kult brothers were\n",
    "viciously attacked. Someone cut off one of Jeffrey's ears and part of the other,\n",
    "then cut out a portion of his tongue.  Michael received a skull fracture and\n",
    "other injuries from the hail of debris. Deborah Getman was lucky. A black man\n",
    "whisked her to safety while the crowd's attention was on the Kults.\n",
    "\n",
    "The brothers' lives were saved by two police officers, Manny Lopez and Arnold\n",
    "Gibbs, who said they went in to make the rescue under gunfire from the crowd.\n",
    "\n",
    "An 11-year-old girl and a 75-year-old man hit by the car were taken to\n",
    "hospitals; they survived, although doctors had to amputate one of the girl's\n",
    "legs.\n",
    "\n",
    "But by this time the neighborhood had become a war zone. Stores were going up in\n",
    "flames as mobs sought out and attacked all that was white or that stood as a\n",
    "symbol of white dominance. The police and National Guard were called in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Three Fishermen\n",
    "\n",
    "Around 9:30 P.M., apparently unaware of the uproar, Mr. Higdon and his fishing\n",
    "companions drove along 62d Street, toward the crowd, which had regrouped in the\n",
    "same spot near 12th Parkway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their car, too, was bombarded with debris. It, too, swerved out of control, and\n",
    "crashed near a parking lot. The three were pulled from the car and beaten.\n",
    "Again, the police came in, again under gunfire, they said, to make a rescue.\n",
    "This time they were too late. The two 15-year-old boys were dead when the police\n",

    "So far, five persons, including two 16-year-old juveniles, have been arrested\n",

    "they had been able to make the arrests only because of the help of Liberty City\n",

    "The majority of Liberty City's residents are entrenched in poverty, members of a\n",

    "as elusive as a rainbow.  Life in the community, where the median income is but\n",
    "$271 above the Federal Government's $5,500 poverty mark, is a daily drama of the\n",
    "the have-nots fighting to become haves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lane family lives in a small, four-room apartment in public housing on\n",
    "Northwest 60th Street. The apartment is clean and carpeted. There are pictures\n",
    "of Christ and the Madonna on walls in the living room, and pictures of the four\n",
    "children on walls and atop the television set. Two chairs and a sofa are\n",
    "clustered around the television set and two aquariums in the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the apartment, Doreen Hoskins, the mother, and Hilton Lane, the father,\n",

    "'We Are All People'\n",

    "''First of all, my son is not a murderer,'' Mrs. Hoskins, a stout but genteel\n",
    "woman, said sternly, pivoting to one side in the chair in which she had been\n",
    "sitting while watching soap operas. ''I'm a churchgoing lady,'' she declared,\n",
    "''and I don't do anything to anybody.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''I know my son didn't kill those people,'' she said, ''because I teach my\n",

    "people.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I know the Lord will make a way and all I can do is pray,'' she said\n",
    "confidently. ''My son called me, crying, to say they had arrested him, and I\n",
    "told him to pray and trust the Lord.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The family has received food stamps, Mrs. Hoskins said, since she became unable\n",
    "to work after an automobile accident. Their primary income is the $130 a week\n",
    "that Mr. Lane brings home for driving truck for a company where he has worked 15\n",
    "years.\n",
    "\n",
    "''All I can do with that little money is to make sure they have decent clothes\n",
    "on their backs,'' Mr. Lane, a small, intense man, said with some bitterness.\n",

    "Nathaniel Lane dropped out of high school in his junior year to go to work, his\n",
    "mother said. ''I wanted him to finish but you know how children is,'' she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to court records, Nathaniel had had only minor brushes with the law.\n",
    "Last October he was arrested on a charge of improperly exhibiting a weapon and\n",
    "in February he was charged with loitering.  Both cases were dismissed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mrs. Hoskins said the family had lived in the neighborhood 20 years. ''It's no\n",

    "forth across the walls.\n",

    "block from their home. Moving to the kitchen window that overlooks the parking\n",

    "said.  ''I know they didn't do it,'' Mrs. Capers insisted, on the verge of\n",
    "tears. ''They were here with me. I know they didn't do it.'' Both Leonard and\n",
    "Lawrence Capers dropped out of school; both have police records. Leonard had\n",
    "been arrested for theft and driving without a license. There was a warrant\n",
    "outstanding for him on the license charge at the time of the riots. The records\n",

    "Lawrence's record includes arrests for larceny, assault and battery, possession\n",
    "of stolen property, carrying a concealed weapon, possession of drugs and\n",

    "\n",
    "Until tomorrow, when Mr. McGovern faces his first Democratic primary challenge\n",
    "in his 18 years in the Senate, all South Dakotans, churchgoers and\n",
    "nonchurchgoers alike, will be unable to listen to their radios for long without\n",

    "By now such arguments are almost as familiar to most South Dakotans as the lined\n",
    "face of their senior Senator, the 1972 Democratic Presidential nominee. Unlike\n",
    "the wheat, cattle and hogs on which this state's economy depends, however, the\n",
    "negative advertising is not entirely homegrown. Nor will it cease if Mr.\n",

    "\n",
    "A Top-Priority Target\n",
    "\n",
    "For almost two years the mailings and leaflets and the television, radio and\n",
    "newspaper advertisements have been pumped into South Dakota by national\n",
    "anti-abortion and conservative political groups that have joined forces to try\n",
    "to defeat liberal legislators around the country. Senators Frank Church of\n",
    "Idaho, Birch Bayh of Indiana, John C. Culver of Iowa and Alan Cranston of\n",
    "California are also on the socalled ''hit lists'' of many of these groups, but\n",
    "Senator McGovern is their top-priority target.\n",
    "\n",
    "''McGovern is a liberal Senator from a conservative state, and his record really\n",
    "is outrageous,'' said John T. Dolan, executive director of the National\n",
    "Conservative Political Action Committee, a Virginia-based organization that\n",
    "sponsored the current radio commercials. ''Not every member of the U.S. Senate\n",
    "pals around with Castro. We felt we could make McGovern vulnerable.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. McGovern says the assault has taken its toll. ''It's hurt,'' he remarked.\n",
    "''I'm always answering negative questions: 'Is it true you're a pal of Fidel\n",
    "Castro's, that you sold the Panama Canal to the Communists, that you want to\n",
    "kill the unborn?' It's all these offthe-wall right-wing ideas. They've been\n",

    "While few of his critics believe Mr. McGovern can be defeated in the primary,\n",
    "they hope the damage inflicted will help set him up for defeat in November.\n",
    "\n",
    "The National Conservative Political Action Committee alone has spent an\n",

    "them the leading Republican candidate, Representative James Abdnor.\n",
    "\n",
    "''If we had $2 million, we'd spend it against him,'' Mr. Dolan said, adding that\n",
    "the $3.4 million that the committee has already spent on campaigns around the\n",
    "country will rise to $5.5 million by November.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the other national organizations opposing Mr. McGovern are the National\n",

    "\n",
    "Mr. McGovern estimates these groups have spent more than $250,000 to attack him\n",
    "and promote his rivals.  Such expenditures are made possible by what the Senator\n",
    "calls ''a glaring loophole'' in Federal election laws. No group or individual\n",
    "may contribute more than $5,000 to support a given candidate, but unlimited\n",
    "funds may be spent against a candidate, or on ''independent'' efforts in favor\n",
    "of a candidate, as the National Conservative Political Action Committee is doing\n",
    "in support of Mr.  Abdnor, the Republican front-runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Mr. Abdnor concedes that a poll the committee conducted and brought to him\n",
    "last fall influenced his decision to seek the nomination, he denies that his\n",
    "announcement was coordinated with a flood of anti-McGovern television\n",
    "advertisements that appeared immediately before and after he entered the race.\n",
    "The McGovern forces, charging collusion, have filed a complaint with the Federal\n",

    "The Senator, who has already spent more than $750,000 on his reelection effort,\n",

    "conservative political interests. ''I worry about the right-to-lifers getting\n",
    "into bed with these extremist right-wing groups,'' he said. ''A lot of\n",

    "of political dupes.''\n",

    "In his view, the anti-abortion groups are responsible for the candidacy of his\n",

    "supports a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion. Mr. Schumaker, a\n",
    "political novice, was born in South Dakota but left 1961 and did not return\n",

    "There also was a report of fires in some barracks. A base fire truck was called\n",
    "out.\n",

    "More than 200 civilians were evacuated from the base, Mr. McAda said.  The\n",

    "back inside the camp by midafternoon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The refugees in the first breakout vaulted over a low wall at the compound. Some\n",
    "200 of them were stopped by a cordon of state troopers on Arkansas Highway 22\n",
    "between the fort and the city of Barling, about a mile away. The others were\n",
    "caught by armed soldiers at a roadblock just outside Barling. The pursuing\n",
    "officers reportedly struck a number of refugees on their heads, backs and legs.\n",
    "\n",
    "One Cuban was taken to a hospital for treatment of a head injury.  The\n",

    "after he was apparently was stabbed by a fellow refugee.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authorities at the base said that about 150 Cubans began throwing stones and\n",

    "\n",
    "Angered by Delays in Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The refugees, frustrated by delays in processing, shouted ''Libertad'' and\n",
    "marched down the camp's main street toward the front gate. The mob swelled to\n",
    "300 as refugees at the gate and some along the way joined the march.\n",
    "\n",
    "About a dozen military policemen in riot gear at the gate made no attempt to\n",
    "stop the Cubans from leaving.  Brig. Gen. James E. Drummond, commander of the\n",

    "handled as quickly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attempted escapes and the two stone-throwing incidents were part of a series\n",
    "of confrontations between law enforcement officials and refugees. The base has\n",

    "MIDDLETOWN LAST Apr. 4, a 20-year-old woman student at Wesleyan University\n",
    "walked into a campus fraternity house at 4 A.M. and was confronted and then\n",
    "grabbed by two fraternity men, who picked her up, spun her around and kissed\n",
    "her. Badly frightened, she ran from the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decade ago such an episode might have passed without much notice or comment,\n",
    "but the incident at the Chi Psi fraternity house has aroused a bitter\n",
    "controversy at the small liberal arts college.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wesleyan faculty has requested the formation of a special committee to\n",
    "examine the problem of sexual harassment at the school and a women's group has\n",
    "accused Colin G. Campbell, the president of the university, of taking action\n",
    "that will discourage female students from reporting incidents of sexual\n",
    "harassment or abuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the acrimony centers on Mr. Campbell's decision to reduce the penalties\n",
    "meted out to the two fraternity men by a student court, but the debate is being\n",
    "carried on in an atmosphere in which the safety of women students on campus has\n",
    "become a widespread concern.  Eight incidents of sexual assault were reported on\n",
    "or near campus this school year and last month, Argus, the student newspaper,\n",
    "devoted most of the front page of an issue to stories about the episode\n",
    "involving the fraternity men, a rape near campus and the transfer of a security\n",
    "guard accused of harassing women students.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current conflict also reflects a sharp clash in values between women's\n",
    "groups on campus and a male fraternity that has, according to several of its own\n",
    "members, a reputation as an ''animal house.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''We're thought of as animals and there isn't much sympathy for us here on\n",
    "campus,'' a member of Chi Psi said. ''A lot of the kids are very serious about\n",
    "their grades and so forth but we like to play football, party and do a lot of\n",
    "social things.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Wesleyan has a high academic reputation and takes pride in the ability and\n",
    "diversity of its students. The previously all-male college went coeducational 10\n",
    "years ago and now about half of its 2,500 students are women. The\n",
    "once-predominant role of fraternities on campus has declined sharply in the last\n",
    "decade and today only about 10 percent of the students are members, according to\n",
    "school officials. At the same time, feminist issues and questions about the role\n",
    "and status of women have become prominent topics at Wesleyan, as they have on\n",
    "other campuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The woman who was allegedly accosted by the two fraternity men filed a formal\n",
    "complaint against them with a college official, who referred the matter to the\n",
    "Student Judicial Board, a five-member student court that has the power to expel\n",
    "students for disciplinary infractions. After a formal hearing last month, the\n",
    "court decided to suspend one of the men, a junior, from school for one semester\n",
    "and to withhold the diploma of the second student, a senior, for one year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two students appealed the court's decision to Mr. Campbell, and last week,\n",
    "for only the second time in his 10 years as president at Wesleyan, Mr. Campbell\n",
    "reduced the penalties imposed by the student court.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case was the first in which Wesleyan students had been disciplined as a\n",
    "result of allegations of sexual harassment. In a prepared statement, Mr.\n",
    "Campbell said that the court had established a new ''standard of conduct'' for a\n",
    "college community whose values were ''undergoing rapid change.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The president also said that Wesleyan would not condone such conduct and that\n",
    "''notice has been given that such violations will be dealt with severely.'' He\n",
    "said that his decision to reduce the penalties in the case of the two fraternity\n",
    "men ''should not dull either our awareness of that fact or the educational\n",
    "purpose which has been served.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Campbell said that he approved of the new standard established by the board,\n",
    "''but in this case, the violators of that standard did not have the advantage of\n",
    "prior notice and therefore could not be expected to anticipate such severe\n",
    "penalties as a consequence of their actions.''\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the fraternity men, the junior, was placed on disciplinary probation. The\n",
    "senior was assigned to do an unidentified ''project.'' (The project is writing a\n",
    "30-page paper on sexism.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Campbell's decision to reduce the penalties met with bitter opposition from\n",
    "a coalition of women's groups, who asked him to reverse his decision. Mr.\n",
    "Campbell refused.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The administration's action can be interpreted as meaning that sexual assault\n",
    "and harassment do not exist because we don't have any rules about this kind of\n",
    "behavior,'' said Jane Cooper, a senior, who is active in an ad hoc student\n",
    "committee on sexual assault and harassment. Wesleyan has no disciplinary rules\n",
    "that deal with sexual harassment and one of the changes women's groups on campus\n",
    "are seeking is a specific grievance procedure to handle such complaints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some faculty members are also sympathetic. Last week, the faculty approved a\n",
    "resolution requesting the establishment of a committee that will investigate the\n",
    "problem and explore the feasibility of establishing a grievance procedure for\n",
    "complaints involving sexual harassment.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Women basically do not feel safe walking across campus or walking into a\n",
    "fraternity house,'' said Allan Johnson, an assistant professor of sociology.\n",
    "''The administration really doesn't know what to do about this problem and it\n",
    "isn't particularly motivated to do anything about it.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Campbell could not be reached for comment but a spokesman for the university\n",
    "said that the president was concerned about the problem and that the\n",
    "administration would be receptive to any suggestions from faculty, staff or\n",
    "students.\n",
    "\n",
    "The debate about Mr. Campbell's decision has also been marked by confusion since\n",
    "school officials have declined to identify the woman complainant or the two\n",
    "fraternity men. The woman could not be reached for comment but the fraternity\n",
    "men agreed to be interviewed on the condition that their names not be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We were just fooling around. Playing. It was nothing. We picked her up, swung\n",
    "her around in the air and kissed her. She became hysterical and ran out,'' one\n",
    "of the two students said.\n",
    "\n",
    "''This happens to us for kissing a girl at 4 o'clock in the morning. It's\n",
    "unbelievable,'' the other fraternity man said. (The woman, who was looking for\n",
    "her boyfriend, had walked in on an early morning party at the fraternity house\n",
    "when the incident occurred.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both men denied that the incident had any sexual overtones and both accused\n",
    "their female accuser of exaggerating the episode completely out of proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The woman alleged that the two men pinned her to a wall while one of them thrust\n",
    "his tongue into her mouth. Both students denied this but one of them admitted\n",
    "that he had not been entirely truthful with the student court. ''I lied to the\n",
    "board. I told them I'd had about five beers when I really had about 15,'' he\n",
    "said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The student court, however, ruled that the incident was not harmless horseplay\n",
    "and it has not changed its mind, according to Julia Imber, a senior who has been\n",
    "on the board for two years. ''We heard both sides and reached our own\n",
    "conclusions,'' she said. ''We don't dispute the right of the two students to\n",
    "appeal the matter to President Campbell but we stand by our original decision.''\n",

    "''It's the longest siege in Indian history,'' said Howard Berman, a lawyer, as\n",
    "he walked through the traditionalist Mohawk encampment near Racquette Point on\n",
    "the St.  Lawrence River, about eight miles northeast of Massena.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since mid-August 1979, Mr. Berman's clients, a small group of traditional - or\n",
    "longhouse - Mohawks, have lived within a fourbuilding compound in sight of the\n",
    "international bridge that crosses the St. Lawrence from the United States to\n",
    "Cornwall, Ontario. Although the ''besieged'' have not been forced to leave, they\n",
    "have stationed sentries to warn them in case state or tribal authorities try to\n",
    "enter, which they did once last year, making several arrests.\n",
    "\n",
    "At least 15 of the perhaps 50 Mohawks staying here face state charges stemming\n",
    "from a nine-hour takeover of the Akwesasne Community Center on the reservation\n",
    "in reaction to the arrest of a chief over a property dispute. The action, on May\n",
    "29, 1979, pitted traditionalist Mohawks against others who support the\n",
    "reservation's elective system of government. The takeover ended peacefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "The anniversary of the takeover passed last Thursday, but the basic\n",
    "jurisdictional issues that have divided this reservation for decades remain\n",
    "unsolved. Lately, however, the traditionalists have come to believe that their\n",
    "resistance has won them supporters not only outside, but also inside, the\n",
    "reservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionalist Is Optimistic\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditionalists assert that the path they are following leads back to an\n",
    "agriculture-based economy and away from an economy based on government programs,\n",
    "which has developed in the last 20 years. The movement is parallel to\n",
    "developments on other reservations throughout the country. At the same time, two\n",
    "other rival groups on the reservation are vying for power to control millions of\n",
    "dollars in grants.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Nine months ago we got 108 people to sign a petition asking that charges be\n",
    "dropped against the occupiers,'' said Mike Myers, a traditionalist. ''Recently,\n",
    "we got 1,035 signatures on the same petitions. People have closed together in a\n",
    "resistant stance. They are saying enough is enough. The system has to change.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The St. Regis reservation has a crazy-quilt of governmental systems, with\n",
    "overlapping county, state and national codes, as well as competing tribal\n",
    "authorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "''It takes years to understand this place,'' said Diane Lazore, who was born on\n",
    "the lands of the Canadian St. Regis Band, which bordered those of the Mohawks of\n",
    "the St. Regis reservation in the United States. Each reservation has a separate\n",
    "government, but Mohawks pass freely between both sides. There are approximately\n",
    "3,000 Mohawks on the American side and 7,000 in Canada.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elective System of Government\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been an elective system of government on the reservation in the United\n",
    "States since the late 1880's. Three chiefs are elected, one each year, for\n",
    "three-year terms. The election is traditionally held in June, although there is\n",
    "no constitution or formal elective procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditionalists have their own system of hereditary chiefs, and they contend\n",
    "that these chiefs should govern the entire reservation.  Central to the\n",
    "traditionalist position is the contention that the Mohawks of St. Regis are one\n",
    "nation within the six-nation Iroquois Confederacy. As members of a sovereign\n",
    "nation, the traditionalists do not recognize state or Federal authorities. The\n",
    "elective system's supporters make no claim for nation status or sovereignty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionalists refuse to vote in tribal elections, and Rudolph Hart Jr., the\n",
    "tribal planner and a son of one of the elective chiefs, believes that this\n",
    "refusal to vote makes the traditionalists an insignificant factor in tribal\n",
    "politics.\n",
    "\n",
    "'Dissident' Faction Emerges\n",
    "\n",
    "Mohawk politics were further confused or clarified - it depends upon whom one\n",
    "talks to - by the emergence this spring of a third faction, the so-called\n",
    "''dissident'' party, which held an election and replaced the three tribal\n",
    "chiefs. But the State of New York has not recognized the election, which was not\n",
    "the traditional June voting, and the previously elected chiefs remain in office.\n",
    "The traditionalists have supported the dissidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Hart sees the emergence of the dissidents as a simple attempt to gain\n",
    "political power. ''In 1969, the Mohawks received a total of $2,200 in outside\n",
    "grants,'' he said. ''Last year, we received over $5 million. The stakes here are\n",
    "control of that $5 million.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Also at stake, according to Mr. Hart, is the settlement of a Mohawk land claim\n",
    "suit. In exchange for their surrender of a claim upon land that includes\n",
    "downtown Massena, the elected chiefs have tentatively agreed to accept $6\n",
    "million and 9,750 acres of state forest land. Dissidents and traditionalists\n",
    "oppose the accord.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debate over the land claim settlement is recent, but a controversy over the size\n",
    "and power of the tribal police force is long-standing.  An arm of the Franklin\n",
    "County Sheriff's Department, the force is composed entirely of Indians.\n",
    "Recently, a Federal training grant has allowed the tribe to increase the number\n",
    "of police from 7 to 17.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Berman, a non-Indian who along with William M. Kunstler, has been\n",
    "representing the traditionalists in court, sees the expansion of the police\n",
    "force as ''either a dangerous move toward the creation of a police state or a\n",
    "dangerous abuse of welfare funds.''\n",
    "\n",
    "On June 20, the Mohawks arrested for the community center occupation are to go\n",
    "to trial on conspiracy charges. Loran Thompson, the traditionalist chief whose\n",
    "arrest in May 1979 led to the takeover but who was not indicted for the\n",
    "occupation, sees mere participation in the trial as a defeat. ''We may win in\n",

    "Details of an agreement that calls for an indefinite delay of the demolition of\n",
    "two parks at Tudor City were disclosed yesterday. Both sides said they would\n",
    "seek court approval of the agreement today.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two parks straddle 42d Street west of First Avenue. Under the agreement, the\n",
    "delay would permit the completion of plans for swapping the two parks for a\n",
    "city-owned playground on the southeast corner of 42d Street and First Avenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tudor City parks are owned by companies headed by Harry B.  Helmsley. If the\n",
    "swap can be effected, Mr. Helmsley would build an apartment and office building\n",
    "of about 50 stories on the site of the city playground.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agreement would allow the plan for the exchange to be worked out by Mr.\n",
    "Helmsley, city and state officials and the Tudor City Tenants Association.\n",
    "\n",
    "New Park Facility Possible\n",
    "\n",
    "According to State Senator Roy M. Goodman - who held a meeting Friday of people\n",
    "involved in the 10-year-old effort to save the parks - the solution might call\n",
    "for Mr. Helmsley to contribute toward the another community recreational\n",
    "facility to replace the playground involved in the swap.\n",
    "\n",
    "One site under serious consideration, he said, is a city-owned parking lot\n",
    "between 34th and 35th Streets on a strip along the East River, east of the the\n",
    "Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Harry Scanlan, construction and development director for Helmsley Enterprises,\n",
    "said that if the 34th Street playground proposal was ''in the realm of reason,\n",
    "Mr. Helmsley will give it consideration.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing a rally of residents yesterday afternoon in the parks, Senator\n",
    "Goodman, Republican of Manhattan, said that a wooden fence around the north park\n",
    "would be taken down tomorrow morning.  Construction workers had started putting\n",
    "up the fence early one morning over the Memorial Day weekend, but the work was\n",
    "quickly halted by residents who first carried off the lumber and then obtained a\n",
    "restraining order that is answerable today in State Supreme Court.\n",
    "\n",
    "Court's Approval Sought\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than hearing further arguments on the restraining order, the court will\n",
    "be asked to accept the new agreement, which was reached Friday.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the agreement, Mr. Helmsley would give the tenants' association 15 days'\n",
    "notice of any plan to resume demolition. In return, the restraining order is to\n",
    "be lifted and Mr. Helmsley is to drop his motion to dismiss it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agreement was contingent on having the State Department of Parks put off a\n",
    "June 13 hearing on a proposal that the Tudor City complex be recommended by the\n",
    "state to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places. And the\n",
    "department did agree over the weekend to defer the hearing, without setting a\n",
    "new date. The historic designation would have posed a procedural hurdle for Mr.\n",
    "Helmsley.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Parks Department will give 30 days' written notice of a rescheduling of a\n",
    "hearing on Tudor City.  The plan for a swap was first put forward more than a\n",
    "year ago by the city, in response to a proposal by Mr. Helmsley to erect a\n",
    "50-story residential tower on a small city-owned park opposite the United\n",

       "' An agreement was reached on June 2, 1980, to delay the demolition of two parks at Tudor City indefinitely, allowing for plans to swap the parks for a city-owned playground on the southeast corner of 42nd Street and First Avenue. Harry B. Helmsley, who owns the parks, would build an apartment and office building on the site of the city playground if the swap can be made. The plan would involve Mr. Helmsley, city and state officials, and the Tudor City Tenants Association working out the details. A new community recreational facility might also be built as part of the deal, with a possible location being a city-owned parking lot between 34th and 35th Streets on the East River. Construction workers had put up a wooden fence around one of the parks over Memorial Day weekend, but it was quickly taken down by residents who obtained a restraining order. The court was asked to accept this new agreement instead of hearing further arguments on the restraining order. The State Department of Parks agreed to defer a hearing on Tudor City being recommended for historic designation to allow for this swap to be made. Conflicting appraisals of the city-owned parcel at 42nd Street and First Avenue had caused difficulty in making the exchange, with one appraiser valuing it higher than the other two due to its potential use as a hotel instead of a residential tower. The City Planning Commission was optimistic that the dissenting appraiser would revise his valuation once a deed was drawn up for the playground site with restrictions on new building types.'"
