Over the course of her career, Li won seven WTA singles titles and two Grand Slam singles titles at the 2011 French Open and 2014 Australian Open.  Li's rise to prominence came after those victories, which made her the first and only Grand Slam singles champion from East Asia and Asia as a whole.  Prior to this, she had already become the first player representing an East Asian and Asian country to appear in a Grand Slam singles final, a milestone she achieved at the 2011 Australian Open.  Li was also the runner-up at the 2013 Australian Open and 2013 WTA Tour Championships, a three-time quarterfinalist at Wimbledon and a semifinalist at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and 2013 US Open.  Among her other most notable accolades, she was the first Chinese player to win a WTA tour title at the Guangzhou International Women's Open in 2004, the first to reach a Grand Slam singles quarterfinal at the 2006 Wimbledon Championships, and the first to break into the world's top 10.

There is a noted professional rivalry between them – between the 2001 US Open and the 2017 Australian Open tournaments, they met in nine Grand Slam singles finals.  They became the first two players, female or male, to play in 4 consecutive grand slam singles finals from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open; Serena famously won all 4 to complete the first of two \"Serena Slams\".  Between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year span, they collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles (Venus won 5 and Serena won 7).  By winning the 2001 Australian Open women's doubles title, they became the 5th pair to complete the Career Doubles Grand Slam and the only pair to complete the Career Doubles Golden Slam.  At the time, Venus and Serena were only 20 and 19 years old, respectively.  Since then they have gone on to add another two Olympic gold medals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics.  Nearly a decade later, the duo would go on to win 4 consecutive grand slam doubles titles from 2009 Wimbledon through 2010 Roland Garros, which would catapult them to co-No.  1 doubles players on 7 June 2010.

      "The answer is\n",
      " The narrator of \"Frontier\" who is associated with Laredo is Walter Darwin Coy. However, it's important to note that the text does not specifically mention that any of the members of \"The Lone Gunmen\" from the television series were involved in the production or casting of \"Gunmen from Laredo,\" the 1959 western film mentioned in the text. The only connection between \"The Lone Gunmen\" and Laredo is that some of the actors who portrayed them, such as Bruce Harwood, have appeared in other productions set in or around Laredo. So, while it's an intriguing question, the answer based on the text provided is that Walter Darwin Coy was the narrator of \"Frontier\" associated with Laredo.\n",

The coup rendered powerless the democratically elected government of Yun Bo-seon and ended the Second Republic, installing a reformist military Supreme Council for National Reconstruction effectively led by Park, who took over as Chairman after General Chang's arrest in July./nHan Myeong-sook (born March 24, 1944; Korean: 한명숙 ] ) was the Prime Minister of South Korea from April 2006 to March 2007.

She was from the United New Democratic Party (UNDP) as a member of the Korean National Assembly (representative) for Ilsan-gab, and is a graduate of Ewha Womans University in Seoul with a degree in French literature.  She resigned as Prime Minister on March 7, 2007 and declared her presidential candidacy.  But she did not succeed in the nominations.  In 2008 she ran for parliament, but was not elected.  However, in January 2012 she was elected leader of the main oppositional Democratic United Party (DUP) before the April legislative elections and became a member of parliament.  But the liberals did not manage to defeat the ruling Saenuri Party and Han stepped down as party leader in April 2012.  In August 2015, Han was convicted of receiving illegal donations at the amount of 900 million KRW, and sentence to two years in prison.  She is ineligible to run for public office for ten years after her prison term.  She became the first former prime minister of the Republic of Korea to serve a prison time./nChang Dae-hwan (also Chang Dae-whan; born 21 March 1952) is a South Korean businessman.

Japanese rule of Korea was the outcome of a process that began with the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876, whereby a complex coalition of the Meiji government, military, and business officials sought to integrate Korea both politically and economically into the Empire of Japan.  A major stepping-stone towards the Japanese occupation of Korea was the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905, in which the then-Korean Empire was declared a protectorate of Japan.  The annexation of Korea by Japan was set up in the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910, which was never actually signed by the Korean Regent, Gojong./nBorn and raised in Kyong Ki Do, South Korea, Master Tommy Chang is a Korean-Canadian world-renowned 7th degree Taekwondo and 8Th Degree Hapkido instructor and Grandmaster, actor, stunt performer, stunt coordinator and producer.

In addition, he is a WTF-certified Master Instructor of Taekwondo and a Canadian National Referee (1st Class)./nAt the conclusion of World War II the Allied nations began the process of disarmament of Axis controlled regions.  Japan occupied Korea at this time and had been in control since 1910.  In 1945, the decision was made to have American Marines forces oversee Japanese surrender and disarmament south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would facilitate the change of power to the north.  At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action.  The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era.  Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea.  Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system.  Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support.  South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union.  The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea's request for weapons and troops.  North Korea convinced the Soviet Union to supply them with the weapons and support they requested.  This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea.  North Korea saw its opportunity and attacked South Korean forces at the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950 and thus initiating the Korean War./nChang Mi-hee (born December 8, 1958) is a South Korean actress active since 1976.

Shortly thereafter, GT itself was purchased by Schwinn, which in turn was purchased by Pacific Bicycle Group, a large Taiwanese conglomerate known mainly for low end, mass market bicycles and parts.

She resigned as Prime Minister on March 7, 2007 and declared her presidential candidacy.  But she did not succeed in the nominations.  In 2008 she ran for parliament, but was not elected.  However, in January 2012 she was elected leader of the main oppositional Democratic United Party (DUP) before the April legislative elections and became a member of parliament.  But the liberals did not manage to defeat the ruling Saenuri Party and Han stepped down as party leader in April 2012.

Japanese rule of Korea was the outcome of a process that began with the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876, whereby a complex coalition of the Meiji government, military, and business officials sought to integrate Korea both politically and economically into the Empire of Japan.  A major stepping-stone towards the Japanese occupation of Korea was the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905, in which the then-Korean Empire was declared a protectorate of Japan.  The annexation of Korea by Japan was set up in the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910, which was never actually signed by the Korean Regent, Gojong./nBorn and raised in Kyong Ki Do, South Korea, Master Tommy Chang is a Korean-Canadian world-renowned 7th degree Taekwondo and 8Th Degree Hapkido instructor and Grandmaster, actor, stunt performer, stunt coordinator and producer.

In addition, he is a WTF-certified Master Instructor of Taekwondo and a Canadian National Referee (1st Class)./nAt the conclusion of World War II the Allied nations began the process of disarmament of Axis controlled regions.  Japan occupied Korea at this time and had been in control since 1910.  In 1945, the decision was made to have American Marines forces oversee Japanese surrender and disarmament south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would facilitate the change of power to the north.  At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action.  The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era.  Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea.  Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system.  Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support.  South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union.  The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea's request for weapons and troops.  North Korea convinced the Soviet Union to supply them with the weapons and support they requested.  This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea.  North Korea saw its opportunity and attacked South Korean forces at the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950 and thus initiating the Korean War./nChang Mi-hee (born December 8, 1958) is a South Korean actress active since 1976.

She co-founded, with Ellen Gates Starr, an early settlement house in the United States, Chicago's Hull House that would later become known as one of the most famous settlement houses in America.  In an era when presidents such as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson identified themselves as reformers and social activists, Addams was one of the most prominent reformers of the Progressive Era.  She helped America address and focus on issues that were of concern to mothers, such as the needs of children, local public health, and world peace.  In her essay “Utilization of Women in City Government,” Jane Addams noted the connection between the workings of government and the household, stating that many departments of government, such as sanitation and the schooling of children, could be traced back to traditional women’s roles in the private sphere.  Thus, these were matters of which women would have more knowledge than men, so women needed the vote to best voice their opinions.  She said that if women were to be responsible for cleaning up their communities and making them better places to live, they needed to be able to vote to do so effectively.  Addams became a role model for middle-class women who volunteered to uplift their communities.  She is increasingly being recognized as a member of the American pragmatist school of philosophy, and is known by many as the first woman \"public philosopher in the history of the United States.  In 1889 she co-founded Hull House, and in 1920 she was a co-founder for the ACLU.

After including a female sexual fantasy in a novel she submitted for publishing, her editor objected, and Friday shelved the novel.  Later, after other women began writing and talking about sex publicly, Friday began thinking about writing a book about female sexual fantasies, first collecting fantasies from her friends, and then advertising in newspapers and magazines for more.  She organized these narratives into \"rooms\", and each is identified by the woman's first name, except for the last chapter, \"odd notes\", which is presented as the \"fleeting thoughts\" of many anonymous women.

However, in January 2012 she was elected leader of the main oppositional Democratic United Party (DUP) before the April legislative elections and became a member of parliament.  But the liberals did not manage to defeat the ruling Saenuri Party and Han stepped down as party leader in April 2012.  In August 2015, Han was convicted of receiving illegal donations at the amount of 900 million KRW, and sentence to two years in prison.

Japanese rule of Korea was the outcome of a process that began with the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876, whereby a complex coalition of the Meiji government, military, and business officials sought to integrate Korea both politically and economically into the Empire of Japan.  A major stepping-stone towards the Japanese occupation of Korea was the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905, in which the then-Korean Empire was declared a protectorate of Japan.  The annexation of Korea by Japan was set up in the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910, which was never actually signed by the Korean Regent, Gojong./nBorn and raised in Kyong Ki Do, South Korea, Master Tommy Chang is a Korean-Canadian world-renowned 7th degree Taekwondo and 8Th Degree Hapkido instructor and Grandmaster, actor, stunt performer, stunt coordinator and producer.

Japan occupied Korea at this time and had been in control since 1910.  In 1945, the decision was made to have American Marines forces oversee Japanese surrender and disarmament south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would facilitate the change of power to the north.  At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action.  The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era.  Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea.  Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system.  Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support.  South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union.  The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea's request for weapons and troops.  North Korea convinced the Soviet Union to supply them with the weapons and support they requested.  This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea.  North Korea saw its opportunity and attacked South Korean forces at the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950 and thus initiating the Korean War./nChang Mi-hee (born December 8, 1958) is a South Korean actress active since 1976.

      "The answer is\n",
      " The text does not provide information about when Chang Ucchin was born that directly answers the question about what event ended during the time of his birth. However, we can infer that Chang Ucchin was born during a time when Korea was under Japanese colonial rule based on the context of the text that he studied western art at Tokyo's Imperial School of Art.\n",

      "The significant historical event that ended during this time was the conclusion of Japanese rule in Korea and the beginning of Korean independence after World War II. Therefore, although the text does not explicitly state that Chang Ucchin was born before or after this event, we can infer that he was born during a period when this event was imminent or had recently occurred.\n",

Japanese rule of Korea was the outcome of a process that began with the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876, whereby a complex coalition of the Meiji government, military, and business officials sought to integrate Korea both politically and economically into the Empire of Japan.  A major stepping-stone towards the Japanese occupation of Korea was the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905, in which the then-Korean Empire was declared a protectorate of Japan.  The annexation of Korea by Japan was set up in the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910, which was never actually signed by the Korean Regent, Gojong./nBorn and raised in Kyong Ki Do, South Korea, Master Tommy Chang is a Korean-Canadian world-renowned 7th degree Taekwondo and 8Th Degree Hapkido instructor and Grandmaster, actor, stunt performer, stunt coordinator and producer.

Japan occupied Korea at this time and had been in control since 1910.  In 1945, the decision was made to have American Marines forces oversee Japanese surrender and disarmament south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would facilitate the change of power to the north.  At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action.  The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era.  Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea.  Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system.  Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support.  South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union.  The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea's request for weapons and troops.  North Korea convinced the Soviet Union to supply them with the weapons and support they requested.  This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea.  North Korea saw its opportunity and attacked South Korean forces at the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950 and thus initiating the Korean War./nChang Mi-hee (born December 8, 1958) is a South Korean actress active since 1976.
