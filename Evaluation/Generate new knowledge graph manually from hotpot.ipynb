This was evidenced by the team's registration at the Balkan Cup tournament during 1929-1931, which started in 1929 (although Albania eventually had pressure from the teams because of competition, competition started first and was strong enough in the duels) .  Albanian National Team was founded on June 6, 1930, but Albania had to wait 16 years to play its first international match and then defeated Yugoslavia in 1946.  In 1932, Albania joined FIFA (during the 12–16 June convention ) And in 1954 she was one of the founding members of UEFA./nEchosmith is an American, Corporate indie pop band formed in February 2009 in Chino, California.
