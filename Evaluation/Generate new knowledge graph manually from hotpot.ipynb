      "es on Fox that debuted December 17, 1989./n\"The Simpsons\" is an American animated television sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company.  The series is a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle epitomized by its eponymous family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie.  It is set in the fictional town of Springfield, and lampoons American culture, society and television, and many aspects of the human condition.  The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks.  Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name.  The shorts became a part of \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" on April 19, 1987 and after a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became a hit series for Fox.  The growing popularity of the series motivated video game developers to create video games based on the series.  Two pinball machines have also been produced; one self-titled, that was only made available for a limited time after the first season finale (1990) and \"The Simpsons Pinball Party\" (2003).  Additionally, several handheld device games have been released, such as \"Bartman: Avenger of Evil\" (1990) and \"Bart Simpson's Cupcake Crisis\" (1991)./nThe Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History is a non-fiction book about the American animated television series \"The Simpsons\".  It was written by John Ortved, and first published in October 2009 by Faber and Faber.  In the United Kingdom, the book is called Simpsons Confidential: The uncensored, totally unauthorised history of the world's greatest TV show by the people that made it.  The book is an oral history of the show, and concentrates particularly on the writers and producers of the show.  The book includes e\n",

      "Moloch: or, This Gentile World is a semi-autobiographical novel written by Henry Miller in 1927-28, initially under the guise of a novel written by his wife, June.  The book went unpublished until 1992, 65 years after it was written and 12 years after Miller’s death.  It is widely considered to be of interest more as a study of Miller’s artistic growth than as a worthy piece of fiction./nThe Launceston by-election of 1874 was fought on 3 July 1874.  The byelection was fought due to the void Election of the incumbent Conservative MP, James Henry Deakin (senior).

It features Nin's relationships with writer Henry Miller, his wife June Miller, the psychoanalyst Otto Rank, her father Joaquín Nin, and her husband Hugh Parker Guiler.  She also copied some of her correspondence with these people into her diary.
