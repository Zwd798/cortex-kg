      "Manifesto Records was a UK based dance music record sub label of Mercury Records which focused on dance music across all genres.  The label began operations in 1995 with the first release being a remix of Donna Summer's \"I Feel Love\" (in which they got Summer to re-record vocals as the original masters had been lost in a fire).  The label had 13 Top 10 hits before being wound down in 2002 (a move partially brought about to \"bottle the labels unique period because of its unprecedented success\").  The label was briefly resurrected by Mercury between 2004 - 2006.  The label was set up and headed by Eddie Gordon and Luke Neville who recruited Judge Jules as A&R.  Jules would recruit Luke Neville.  Ben Cherrill (who would later move to Positiva Records in 2001) also had an active role at the label, joining in 1998.  Notable acts on the label included Todd Terry, Josh Wink, Byron Stingley, The Space Brothers, Yomanda and York.

The mission was headed by Sir Stafford Cripps, a senior left-wing politician and government minister in the War Cabinet of Prime Minister Winston Churchill.  Cripps was sent to negotiate an agreement with the nationalist leaders, speaking for the majority Hindu population, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, speaking for the minority Muslim population.  Cripps worked to keep India loyal to the British war effort in exchange for a promise of full self-government after the war.  Cripps promised to give dominion status after the war as well as elections to be held after the war.  Cripps discussed the proposals with the Indian leaders and published them.  Both the major parties, the Congress and the League rejected his proposals and the mission proved a failure.  Cripps had designed the proposals himself, but they were too radical for both Churchill and the Indians; no middle way was found.  Congress moved towards the Quit India movement whereby it refused to cooperate in the war effort, while the British imprisoned practically the entire Congress leadership for the duration of the war.  Jinnah was pleased to see that the right to opt out of a future Union was included./nMabel Luella Bourne Bassett (August 16, 1876 – 1953) was a Democratic Oklahoma politician who served as the state's Commissioner of Charities and Corrections from 1923 until 1947.

Based on a series of 6 prototype Pioneer III cars built in 1958, the Silverliners represented the first production order of \"modern\" commuter MU equipment purchased by either railroad and earned their name from their unpainted stainless steel construction which contrasted with the painted carbon steel bodies of the pre-war MU fleets.  The cars became a fixture of SEPTA Regional Rail service providing the name to their entire series of EMU railcars before finally being retired in 2012 after 49 years in service./nPolaris Industries is an American manufacturer of snowmobiles, ATV, and neighborhood electric vehicles.
