      "The answer is\n",
      " The narrator of \"Frontier\" who is associated with Laredo is Walter Darwin Coy. However, it's important to note that the text does not specifically mention that any of the members of \"The Lone Gunmen\" from the television series were involved in the production or casting of \"Gunmen from Laredo,\" the 1959 western film mentioned in the text. The only connection between \"The Lone Gunmen\" and Laredo is that some of the actors who portrayed them, such as Bruce Harwood, have appeared in other productions set in or around Laredo. So, while it's an intriguing question, the answer based on the text provided is that Walter Darwin Coy was the narrator of \"Frontier\" associated with Laredo.\n",

But the liberals did not manage to defeat the ruling Saenuri Party and Han stepped down as party leader in April 2012.

Japanese rule of Korea was the outcome of a process that began with the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1876, whereby a complex coalition of the Meiji government, military, and business officials sought to integrate Korea both politically and economically into the Empire of Japan.  A major stepping-stone towards the Japanese occupation of Korea was the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1905, in which the then-Korean Empire was declared a protectorate of Japan.  The annexation of Korea by Japan was set up in the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1910, which was never actually signed by the Korean Regent, Gojong./nBorn and raised in Kyong Ki Do, South Korea, Master Tommy Chang is a Korean-Canadian world-renowned 7th degree Taekwondo and 8Th Degree Hapkido instructor and Grandmaster, actor, stunt performer, stunt coordinator and producer.

In addition, he is a WTF-certified Master Instructor of Taekwondo and a Canadian National Referee (1st Class)./nAt the conclusion of World War II the Allied nations began the process of disarmament of Axis controlled regions.  Japan occupied Korea at this time and had been in control since 1910.  In 1945, the decision was made to have American Marines forces oversee Japanese surrender and disarmament south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would facilitate the change of power to the north.  At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action.  The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era.  Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea.  Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system.  Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support.  South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union.  The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea's request for weapons and troops.  North Korea convinced the Soviet Union to supply them with the weapons and support they requested.  This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea.  North Korea saw its opportunity and attacked South Korean forces at the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950 and thus initiating the Korean War./nChang Mi-hee (born December 8, 1958) is a South Korean actress active since 1976.

Japanese rule of Korea was the outcome of a process that began with the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1876, whereby a complex coalition of the Meiji government, military, and business officials sought to integrate Korea both politically and economically into the Empire of Japan.  A major stepping-stone towards the Japanese occupation of Korea was the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1905, in which the then-Korean Empire was declared a protectorate of Japan.  The annexation of Korea by Japan was set up in the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1910, which was never actually signed by the Korean Regent, Gojong./nBorn and raised in Kyong Ki Do, South Korea, Master Tommy Chang is a Korean-Canadian world-renowned 7th degree Taekwondo and 8Th Degree Hapkido instructor and Grandmaster, actor, stunt performer, stunt coordinator and producer.

Japan occupied Korea at this time and had been in control since 1910.  In 1945, the decision was made to have American Marines forces oversee Japanese surrender and disarmament south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would facilitate the change of power to the north.  At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action.  The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era.  Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea.  Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system.  Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support.  South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union.  The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea's request for weapons and troops.  North Korea convinced the Soviet Union to supply them with the weapons and support they requested.  This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea.  North Korea saw its opportunity and attacked South Korean forces at the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950 and thus initiating the Korean War./nChang Mi-hee (born December 8, 1958) is a South Korean actress active since 1976.

She co-founded, with Ellen Gates Starr, an early settlement house in the United States, Chicago's Hull House that would later become known as one of the most famous settlement houses in America.  In an era when presidents such as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson identified themselves as reformers and social activists, Addams was one of the most prominent reformers of the Progressive Era.  She helped America address and focus on issues that were of concern to mothers, such as the needs of children, local public health, and world peace.  In her essay ‚ÄúUtilization of Women in City Government,‚Äù Jane Addams noted the connection between the workings of government and the household, stating that many departments of government, such as sanitation and the schooling of children, could be traced back to traditional women‚Äôs roles in the private sphere.  Thus, these were matters of which women would have more knowledge than men, so women needed the vote to best voice their opinions.

Japan occupied Korea at this time and had been in control since 1910.  In 1945, the decision was made to have American Marines forces oversee Japanese surrender and disarmament south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would facilitate the change of power to the north.  At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action.  The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era.  Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea.  Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system.  Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support.  South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union.  The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea's request for weapons and troops.  North Korea convinced the Soviet Union to supply them with the weapons and support they requested.  This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea.  North Korea saw its opportunity and attacked South Korean forces at the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950 and thus initiating the Korean War./nChang Mi-hee (born December 8, 1958) is a South Korean actress active since 1976.

      "The answer is\n",
      " The text does not provide information about when Chang Ucchin was born that directly answers the question about what event ended during the time of his birth. However, we can infer that Chang Ucchin was born during a time when Korea was under Japanese colonial rule based on the context of the text that he studied western art at Tokyo's Imperial School of Art.\n",

      "The significant historical event that ended during this time was the conclusion of Japanese rule in Korea and the beginning of Korean independence after World War II. Therefore, although the text does not explicitly state that Chang Ucchin was born before or after this event, we can infer that he was born during a period when this event was imminent or had recently occurred.\n",

Japanese rule of Korea was the outcome of a process that began with the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1876, whereby a complex coalition of the Meiji government, military, and business officials sought to integrate Korea both politically and economically into the Empire of Japan.  A major stepping-stone towards the Japanese occupation of Korea was the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1905, in which the then-Korean Empire was declared a protectorate of Japan.  The annexation of Korea by Japan was set up in the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1910, which was never actually signed by the Korean Regent, Gojong./nBorn and raised in Kyong Ki Do, South Korea, Master Tommy Chang is a Korean-Canadian world-renowned 7th degree Taekwondo and 8Th Degree Hapkido instructor and Grandmaster, actor, stunt performer, stunt coordinator and producer.

In addition, he is a WTF-certified Master Instructor of Taekwondo and a Canadian National Referee (1st Class)./nAt the conclusion of World War II the Allied nations began the process of disarmament of Axis controlled regions.  Japan occupied Korea at this time and had been in control since 1910.  In 1945, the decision was made to have American Marines forces oversee Japanese surrender and disarmament south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would facilitate the change of power to the north.  At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action.  The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era.  Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea.  Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system.  Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support.  South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union.  The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea's request for weapons and troops.  North Korea convinced the Soviet Union to supply them with the weapons and support they requested.  This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea.  North Korea saw its opportunity and attacked South Korean forces at the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950 and thus initiating the Korean War./nChang Mi-hee (born December 8, 1958) is a South Korean actress active since 1976.
